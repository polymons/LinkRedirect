I designed and developed this page to be able to:
- work in an environmentally friendly way (we only need to print one QR code design and we can change and update the contents later)
- count QR code scans at events
- count page visits overall
- monitor conversion rate
- collect anonymous data about user behavior to improve our ability to reach a wider audience (We do not use cookies or store any personal data)
- experiment with different materials
- promote our social media
- reach a multilingual audience
- be accessible to anyone
- make it easy for anyone to share our cause
